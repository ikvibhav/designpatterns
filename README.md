# Designpatterns

## Creational Design Patterns
- Handles creating and cloning new objects

### Singleton
- Intent -
    - Only one object of a class.
    - Single object globally accessible within the program
- Implementation -
    - A private constructor with a public method that instantiates the class if it is not already instantiated



## Misc
- lazy creation - object is not created until its truly needed
