# Designpatterns

## Behavioural Design Patterns
- Focus on how individual objects collaborate to achieve a common goal

### Behavioural Design Pattern
- Intent
    - Defers the implementation of some steps to subclasses
- Implementation
    - An abstract superclass, with some final methods (for common methods) and abstract methods for specific methods in the child 

## Misc
- final - This makes the method declared not be overwritten by subclasses
